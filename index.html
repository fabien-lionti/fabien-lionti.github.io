			<p class="sidenav_text"> 
				Graduated in the field of computer science, applied mathematics and statistics. My main areas of interest revolve around reinforcement learning, computer vision and evolutionary algorithms. The aim of this page is to share the different projects I have worked on to anyone interested. For more information, do not hesitate to contact me at the coordinates below.

								API for handwritten text recognition
							</h3>
							<p class='project_description'> 
								This API allows to recognize handwritten or typed content and convert it into text format. The API is developed in Python and based on the Opencv, TensorFlow and Flask libraries. A web application interfacing with the API has also been implemented in HTML5 / CSS3 and javascript.

								Particle Swarm Optimization
							</h3>
							<p class='project_description'> 
								The Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm is an evolutionary optimization algorithm. Originally inspired by the simulation of social behavior at the level of bird or fish swarm movements. PSO is a metaheuristic, not requiring that the problem to be optimized be continuous. I chose to take an interest and implement this algorithm in order to find the best combinations of hyperparameters of a kernel used to train a Support Vector Machine (SVM). By clicking on the image you will find the detailed code of my implementation in Python

								Least Square Support Vector Machine
							</h3>
							<p class='project_description'>
								 The least square support vector machine (LS-SVM) machine learning algorithm is a derivative version of vapnik's support vector machine that requires solving a system of linear equations instead of a quadratic optimization problem. The implementation of this algorithm starts from the desire to gain a better understanding of kernel-based learning algorithms. My choice of implementation turned to the Least Square version which is rare on the web.

							<p class='project_description'>
								This project contains an implementation of an agent based on the minimax algorithm that can play the game of TicTacToe against humans. By clicking on the image you will find a recursive implementation of this algorithm as well as an implementation of the TicTacToe game in console version.
